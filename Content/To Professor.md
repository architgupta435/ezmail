Dear Sir,
I am extremely sorry for my recent incident in your class. It was wrong of me to browse Facebook in class. I know that you never expected this kind of act from me. I feel very guilty about my act. I am extremely sorry for my actions. Please accept my deepest apologies for any distress caused to you on my part. But now I can understand what you meant when you talked about it being disrespectful and a waste of time. I will hopefully grow out of our stupid behavior and learn to be a respectable, civilized, and decent human being. I promise that from now on I will be good, I will not misbehave in class.

You can expect better and more appropriate behavior from me in the future. I have learned from this experience and understand that a certain level of retraining and professionalism is expected of me in the classroom. I hope our relationship is undamaged by my actions and that I can continue to learn and grow under your guidance.

May I, therefore, pray and hope that you would be kind enough to accept my heartiest apology and give me another chance and oblige thereby.

Yours Sincerely,
[Your Name]
